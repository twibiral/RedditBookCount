## How It Works
### Stage 1 - Prepare Books

[Stage_1-BooksPreparation.ipynb](Stage_1-BooksPreparation.ipynb)

Analyze the book dump from OpenLibrary and remove all duplicates and ambivalent book titles.


### Stage 2 - Find the IDs of all Posts that were posted in the Subreddit

[Stage_2-ScrapeAllPostIDs.ipynb](Stage_2-ScrapeAllPostIDs.ipynb)

Download the ID of every post that was posted in the subreddit via the PRAW API.


### Stage 3 - Download all Posts

[Stage_3-DownloadAndPreparePosts.ipynb](Stage_3-DownloadAndPreparePosts.ipynb)

Use the previously collected IDs to download the post texts. All posts marked as deleted or removed are discarded.


### Stage 4 - Count how often the Book Titles occur in the Posts

[Stage_4-CountBookTitlesInPosts.ipynb](Stage_4-CountBookTitlesInPosts.ipynb)

Generate a regular expression from the book titles and count the largest non-overlapping occurrences for each book title.


### Stage 5 - Clean the resulting Book Counts

[Stage_5-CleanUpBookRanking.ipynb](Stage_5-CleanUpBookRanking.ipynb)

There are many book titles that cannot be uniquely identified as book titles (e.g. 'It' by Stephen King) that have to be removed.

The final book ranking is based on the cleaned ranking.


### Stage 6 - Generate Graphics

[Stage_6-CreateGraphics.ipynb](Stage_6-CreateGraphics.ipynb)

Use the collected data to generate a few plots and automatically update the ranking in this README.md.
